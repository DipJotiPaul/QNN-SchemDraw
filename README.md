# qnn-schemdraw

Schemdraw is a Python package for drawing electrical circuit schematics. I have created an add-on library to draw superconducting nanowire devices, such as constrictions and nTrons.

Schemdraw can be installed from pip using
```
pip install schemdraw
```

A schematic of the DC I-V measurement of nTron is shown.

Another example is an nTron connected with a MOSFET in series with a LED.
